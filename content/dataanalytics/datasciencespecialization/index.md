This is the list of courses that I have pursued as part of my professional development in the field of data analytics.


## Data Science Specialization

###  Major Projects
   + Developing Data Projects
       * [Mileage predictor App using Regression Models][8]
    <ul class="enlarge"> 
    <li>
    <img src="/wwwtest/static/img/apps/word_predictor.png" width="150px" height="100px" alt="MPG Predictor" /> 
    <span> 
    <img src="/wwwtest/static/img/apps/word_predictor_large.png" width="900px" height="600px" alt="MPG Predictor" />
    <br/>MPG Predictor 
    </span>
    </li>
    </ul>

> This app is developed using [Shiny][4] and using regression models, it predicts the mileage of a car using transmission type, number of cyclinders and weight of the car. The source code for the app is available at [Github][8]

   + Swiftkey Capstone Project
       * [Word Predictor App  using Text Mining techniques][1] 
    <ul class="enlarge"> 
    <li>
    <img src="/wwwtest/static/img/apps/mpg_predictor.png" width="150px" height="100px" alt="Word  Predictor" /> 
    <span> 
    <img src="/wwwtest/static/img/apps/mpg_predictor_large.png" width="900px" height="600px" alt="Word Predictor" />
    <br/>Word Predictor 
    </span>
    </li>
    </ul>

> This app is developed using [Shiny][4] and predicts the next word the user is likely to type by using [tm][3] and qdap packages. The app is hosted on Shiny website. The source code for the app is available at [Github][5]

###  Presentations (using rpubs and slidify)
   + Swiftkey Capstone Project 
       * [Presentation using RPres][2]
