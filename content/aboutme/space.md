## Current Space

Chimera is currently renting a small portable office building that is our space for regular meetups, classes, events, and as of December 2013, membership!

This space is great for anyone doing small arts and crafts, jewelry, software or hardware design or anyone working on a computer or who doesn't require a lot of space to work.

**Curious about what equipment and tools we have?** Check out our [list of equipment](/about/equipment/).

*If this sounds interesting to you, learn more about [membership](/membership/).*


## Future Space

We're in the process of an effort to rent a larger fabrication facility that will serve the needs of members that want to do metalwork and other large/messy forms of art.
